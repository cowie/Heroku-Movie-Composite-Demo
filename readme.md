# Movie Composite Demo (heroku side)
## Description

I'm still working on this so like come back later or something. No guarantee it won't ever be good. The goal of the project is to illustrate usages of different data stores to more optimally serve and store data for a seemingly simple, easily understood data set such as movies and metadata surrounding.

#### The data source utilizes a subset of the open TMDB data set on Films, Companies, Countries, Languages and Castings.

This part in particular is centered on a 'consumer' application viewing the database. Think like a scrub TMDB. 

## Prereq's
* Do the things in the sfdx repo first.

## Dev, Build and Test

* srs, do the sfdx repo I have first.
* git clone dis
* run `sh config/herokuAutomation.sh` and marvel at how I don't keep conventions between related repos
* Auth when it asks to auth.
* Wait for me to build more - or do you
